# Changelog

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- Buffered log history reads with regex search, id-based inspection, and explicit history windowing
- Persistent Unity EditMode smoke tests for buffered log filtering and truncation behavior

### Changed

- `snapshot` now defaults to depth `0` with lean root-object metadata and the docs/skill now describe human-mode output guardrails explicitly
- `ucp install --dev` now supports repeat local package refreshes without requiring a changed manifest reference
- The docs website is now built for root hosting instead of `/unity-control-protocol/`, and Pages deploys when `docs/` or `skills/` content changes

### Fixed

- Fixed Windows local package `file:` references so dev bridge installs resolve cleanly in Unity
- Fixed Unity bridge reload nudging on Windows by falling back to `AppActivate` when native foreground APIs are insufficient
- Fixed `ucp object get-fields` human-mode headers to use the returned object name
- Fixed EditMode test duration reporting so completed runs no longer show negative elapsed time

### Fixed
